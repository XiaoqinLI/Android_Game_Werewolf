###### notes and introduction
# reload database schema before you run game simulation for safety

# methods: isnight() adn isday() are integrated in attack and vote REST API, which works fine also.

# my POSTgreSQL default password for postgres is 121314, you need to send your password as a kwarg to match yours when
  creating a Dao.

# add Daybreak and Nightfall in game table.

# Items: Although there are 5 kinds of items in item table, I only support Invisibility potion as instructed,
 meaning only this item can be in treasure chest.

# Treasure: treasure is always active, say michael grab it on day1, day2, if another player get in radius, he/she can grab it as well
