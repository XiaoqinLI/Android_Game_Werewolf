###### notes and introduction ##########

The auto game has been tested on my local machine, if you got some error, meaning you need to change/specify
your password in order to access the database.(My POSTgreSQL default password for postgres is 121314, you need
to send your password as a kwarg to match yours when creating a Dao.)

# methods: isnight() adn isday() are integrated in attack and vote REST API, which works fine also.
Therefore, I do not have extra function support them

# There is no need to Tally up all Vote at Nightfall, just do it in daytime after everyone voted
  then we send the top vated guy to death and check if game is ended before we get into night.
  if not ended, then a nigth will come

# Added Daybreak and Nightfall column in the game table.

# Items: Although there are 5 kinds of items in item table, I only support
 Invisibility potion as instructed in class, meaning only this item can be in treasure chest.

# treasure is always active, say if michael grab it on day 1, then on day 2 if
 any other player gets in the new radius, he/she can grab it as well

# As instructed by Prof. Dickerson, instead of weapon and armor and HP feature, werewolf can
have proper random attack accuracy and village have proper random avoidability
so, if avoidability > accuracy, then village survive from attack.

# CoolDown feature is implemented, but I disabled it since I realize in Instruction, it says each
night only one werewolf attack only once, so next attack will be next day so, there is no reason to set up a 30 mins CoolDown.

# used player_stat table to track the conditions, assigns achievement to user_achievement, there is no use for user_stat
