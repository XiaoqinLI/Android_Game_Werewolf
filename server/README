###### notes and introduction
# For safety, Please reload database schema before you run game simulation

# methods: isnight() adn isday() are integrated in attack and vote REST API, which works fine also.

# There is no need to Tally up all Vote at Nightfall, just do it in daytime after everyone voted
  and check if game is ended before we get into night.

# My POSTgreSQL default password for postgres is 121314, you need to send your password as a kwarg to match yours when
  creating a Dao.

# Added Daybreak and Nightfall in game table.

# Items: Although there are 5 kinds of items in item table, I only support Invisibility potion as instructed,
 meaning only this item can be in treasure chest.

# Landmarks and Treasure: Landmark and Treasures are set at daytime of round 1(day 1);
treasure is always active, say michael grab it on day1,
on day2 if another player get in radius, he/she can grab it as well

# As instructed by Prof. Dickerson, instead of weapon and armor, werewolf have proper random attack accuracy and village have proper random avoidability
so, if avoidability > accuracy, then village survive from attack.
