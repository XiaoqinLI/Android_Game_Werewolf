###### notes and introduction ##########
# For safety, Please reload database schema before you run game simulation

The auto game has been tested on ly local machine, if you got some error, meaning you need to change your password for
database, or contact me if you can't figure out what's going on.

# methods: isnight() adn isday() are integrated in attack and vote REST API, which works fine also, so I do not have extra function support them

# There is no need to Tally up all Vote at Nightfall, just do it in daytime after everyone voted
  and check if game is ended before we get into night.

# My POSTgreSQL default password for postgres is 121314, you need to send your password as a kwarg to match yours when
  creating a Dao.

# Added Daybreak and Nightfall in game table.

# Items: Although there are 5 kinds of items in item table, I only support Invisibility potion as instructed in class,
 meaning only this item can be in treasure chest.

# Landmarks and Treasure: Landmark and Treasures are set at daytime of round 1(day 1);
treasure is always active, say if michael grab it on day 1, then
on day 2 if any other player gets in radius, he/she can grab it as well

# As instructed by Prof. Dickerson, instead of weapon and armor, werewolf have proper random attack accuracy and village have proper random avoidability
so, if avoidability > accuracy, then village survive from attack.

#  "A hairy situation" - be near 3 werewolves at once, This achievement is not implemented due to limited time, it needs other API to support it.
Not hard, but just do not have time to do it...

# CoolDown feature is implemented, but I disabled it since I realize in Instruction, it says each night only one werewolf attack only once, so next attack will be next day
so, there is no reason to set up a 30 mins CoolDown.
