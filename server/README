# my POSTgreSQL default password for postgres is 121314, you need to send your password as a kwarg to match yours when
  creating a Dao.

# add Daybreak and Nightfall in game table.

# Items: Although there are 5 kinds of items in item table, I only support Invisibility potion as instructed,
 meaning only this item can be in treasure chest.
